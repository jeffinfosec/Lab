4. The Credential Theft Shuffle

Pass-the-Hash: grab the hash and use to access a resource. Hash is valid until the user changes the account password.

Pass-the-Ticket: grab the Kerberos ticket(s) and use to access a resource. Ticket is valid until the ticket lifetime expires (typically 7 days).

OverPass-the-Hash: use the password hash to get a Kerberos ticket. Hash is valid until the user changes the account password.

3. Gain Access to the Active Directory Database File (ntds.dit)
Dump LSASS memory with Mimikatz (get Domain Admin credentials)
Create Install From Media (IFM) set using NTDSUtil (Grab NTDS.dit file)
